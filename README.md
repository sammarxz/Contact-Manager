# Contact Manager

I am learning React from the [React front to back](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back/) course and this is the first application of this course.

It's a simple application that manages contacts, but what I've learned and been learning from this project is: 
- how React works 
- JSX 
- Components
- Props 
- States
- Context API
- Forms 
- React Router 
- Lifecycle Methods
- HTTP, etc.


## Usage
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sammarxz/Contact-Manager.git
$ cd contact-manager
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```
